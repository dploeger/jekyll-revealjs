## Fragments

It's also possible to do fragments.

- Start the line with ‘+’ instead of ‘-’ for your fragment item like this:  
  `+ This is a fragment`
+ This is a fragment
+ Your fragment may contain the ‘+’ character
    + You can also indent fragments

<fragment/>You can use &lt;fragment/&gt; to step other content.

--

To start a line with a literal `+`, use `\+`:

```diff
-I am a grate speller
\+I am a great speller
```
